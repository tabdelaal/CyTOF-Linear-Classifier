# CyTOF-Linear-Classifier
## LDA on mass cytometry data

This is a Matlab implementation of "Predicting cell types in single cell mass cytometry data", an automated method to annotate the CyTOF dataset.

A simple Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier is appliead on 5 CyTOF datasets with different sizes and annotation levels.
